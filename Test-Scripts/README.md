# Scripts used for testing the custom model(s)
Please note that the custom dataset is not publicly available. Please note that with these files, there may be filepath locations that are **NOT** a part of the github repo, so some scripts may not work. These are not publicly available files.

## [inference_test.py](https://github.com/jgeorge1316/Senior-Design-2025/blob/main/Test-Scripts/inference_test.py)
Simply script that loads a model, and runs inference on a single image. It does not store the result, but shows the result to the user. Created using Ultralytics [Classify docs](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/classify/) and the [results docs](https://docs.ultralytics.com/reference/engine/results/#ultralytics.engine.results.Results).

## [model_inferency.py](https://github.com/jgeorge1316/Senior-Design-2025/blob/main/Test-Scripts/model_inference.py)
This script was used to get a better grasp of the results object that is generated by [model.predict()](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/predict/). It prints the class names array, the probability of each class, the top1 class index, and the top1 class. It also prints the speed object, which includes the preprocess, inference, and postprocess times. There is also an outside counter which counts the time that it took to do everything. Created using [results docs](https://docs.ultralytics.com/reference/engine/results/#ultralytics.engine.results.Results) and [results.probs docs](https://docs.ultralytics.com/reference/engine/results/#ultralytics.engine.results.Probs).

## [test_model.py](https://github.com/jgeorge1316/Senior-Design-2025/blob/main/Test-Scripts/test_model.py)
This script will go over an entire folder and inference on it. If the folder path is set correctly, and the number in the if statement in line 18 is set correctly, then it will count the total number of images that are correctly identified within the folder. It times the entire operation and prints that. It also prints the total number of correct and wrong images, as well as the percentage that were correct. Created using the concepts learned in [model_inferency.py](https://github.com/jgeorge1316/Senior-Design-2025/blob/main/Test-Scripts/model_inference.py), as well as the understanding that the results object will store the results for every image inferenced on when you inference on an entire folder.

## [test_model_threaded.py](https://github.com/jgeorge1316/Senior-Design-2025/blob/main/Test-Scripts/test_model_threaded.py)
Does the same thing as [test_model.py](https://github.com/jgeorge1316/Senior-Design-2025/blob/main/Test-Scripts/test_model.py), but uses threading to do it much more efficiently and quickly. It also displays a progress bar during the process. Used ChatGPT [citation](https://chatgpt.com/share/67c8906e-6b34-800b-8beb-c7af58081a73), with some slight adjustments to the code it generated.
